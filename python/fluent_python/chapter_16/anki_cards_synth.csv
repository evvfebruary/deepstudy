What are the limitations of operator overloading in Python?,"1. Cannot change the meaning of operators for built-in types
2. Cannot create new operators, only overload existing ones

What is the purpose of __ne__?,__ne__ returns the negated result of __eq__ if __eq__ does not return NotImplemented.
What are the augmented assignment operators?,The augmented assignment operators are += and *=
How does += work with immutable types?,+= works by creating a new instance and rebinding the lefthand variable.

What should in-place operator methods return for mutable objects?,In-place operator methods for mutable objects should return self.
